Optimize the existing codebase for maximum performance and efficiency without changing business logic or user-facing behavior.

Instructions:

Refactor inefficient code, loops, and conditionals.

Optimize database queries (fix N+1 issues, add eager loading, proper indexes).

Cache heavy or repetitive operations (dashboard stats, daily/monthly sales).

Reduce memory usage and avoid loading large datasets (use pagination).

Optimize Laravel-specific features (Eloquent, routes, config, views, middleware).

Move heavy logic out of controllers into services/jobs.

Minimize and optimize frontend assets (CSS, JS, Blade views).

Reduce API payload sizes and unnecessary requests.

Remove dead code and unused dependencies.

Ensure security, stability, and maintainability are preserved.
